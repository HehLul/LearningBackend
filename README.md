The following list is the order in which I have implemented and practiced the Backened concepts taught within their respective project folder names.

1. node-tutorial
2. BasicInfoSite (implemented express basics)
3. expressIntro
4. miniMsgBoard
5. forms

Necessary dependencies to install when working with Backend:

- express-async-handler (for controllers)
- ejs
- express-validation (for forms validator to use bod() and validationResult())
